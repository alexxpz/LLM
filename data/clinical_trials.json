However, the FDA is allowing the use of nivolumab in this study.\n\nThis study will have two arms.

Patients most commonly have small AVMs called telangiectases on the tongue, face, hands, mouth, and throat and the mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. Recurrent nosebleeds are a hallmark of the disease. Large AVMs can also occur in various organs, causing sudden and life-threatening complications.\n\nThe study will examine how patients think and feel about their condition and what actions they take to screen for internal symptoms of the disease.\n\nMen and women 18 years of age and older who have HHT may be eligible for this study. Participants fill out a 30-minute questionnaire, available in print or online, that includes questions about the participant s\n\n* beliefs about HHT\n* actions taken to screen for internal symptoms of HHT\n* experience with HHT\n* current health status, family history and demographic information","detailedDescription":"The proposed study aims to understand the factors that influence screening behaviors of adults with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is a chronic condition, but with early diagnosis followed by adherence to recommended screening guidelines, the major complications of this disorder can be avoided and disability or even death can be prevented. Yet, it has come to the attention of healthcare professionals that the recommended screening is not commonly followed by individuals with HHT, even when the risk of serious complications is known. Nonadherence to screening recommendations is not unique to HHT. It is rather common across chronic conditions, and genetic diseases, such as HHT, are no exception. However, HHT may have an added barrier to screening and treatment adherence in that it is a rare and underdiagnosed condition. Inadequate knowledge of healthcare providers may be a serious barrier to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The Health Belief Model (HBM) can be used to frame this study of HHT screening. The HBM posits that preventive health behaviors will be acted upon if individuals regard themselves as susceptible to the threat, they believe the consequences to be severe, and the perceived benefits outweigh the perceived barriers. In addition to the HBM constructs, this study will also consider the role of illness representations which provide a more personal view of the lived experience of individuals with HHT. A cosss-sectional design will be used to investigate the relationships among the domains of illness representations, HBM constructs (perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, response efficacy, cues to action), and HHT-specific screening guidelines. Participants will be recruited from the HHT Foundation International, Inc., an outline HHT Awareness social group, and HHT Clinics. Participants will be asked to complete either a web-based or a paper survey. The main outcome measure is screening behaviors and intentions to screen for complications associated with HHT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Osler-Rendu-Weber Disease","Osler-Rendu Disease","Telangiectasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic"],"keywords":["Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia","Health Belief Model","Illness Perceptions","Screening","HHT"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":320,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nMen and women who self-report having a diagnosis of HHT.\n\nTo read and write English.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nIndividuals younger than 18.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Barbara B Biesecker","affiliation":"National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), 9000 Rockville Pike","city":"Bethesda","state":"Maryland","zip":"20892","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.98067,"lon":-77.10026}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"15266205","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Bayrak-Toydemir P, Mao R, Lewin S, McDonald J.
